# Stacked Guidelines

Governance is a huge issue currently impeding the progress and reach of decentralized initiatives. After careful consideration, we believe that when used in tandem with Flow modules our stacked guidelines propose a genuine solution. This problem took a more abstract approach to solve, learning from current governments while applying a global, perspective-bound twist gives us stacked-guidelines. Stacked guidelines are the sheets of governance pertaining to the specific interaction taking place. Each part involved in any interaction facilitated on our platforms agrees to the guidelines before being able to continue in the engagement. Additionally, the guidelines may retain their perspective as they are enacted by the mainnet Reaction yet enforced by a Flow. This is useful for instances such as when users are engaging internationally, the system will automatically adjust its constraints based upon the respective region the party originated from.
