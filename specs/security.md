# Security

Cybersecurity is as much about the protocols chosen as it is the execution and integration of the security measures. Meaning if a poorly designed system has extremely well-developed security protocols powering it, no matter how well it may defend against external hacks its users will be actively preyed upon as the weak link in the chain. Adhering to this standard is a grueling, technical task that many tend to shortcut leading to a choppy end-user experience and enabling potential breaches by discouraging proper procedures. With our platform, users can rest assured knowing that each interaction they engage is digitally constrained by the guidelines clearly outlined before being allowed to proceed, secured by cutting edge cryptographic protocols future-proofing the network against a quantum attacker, and breeze through security checkpoints. Each aspect of a user's digital identity is validated via their Flow and done so in a manner that respects the rights of the said user. This is accomplished by wholistically committing to designing a zero-knowledge framework, in-which each action that is outsourced to an external means of completion is authorized only using succinct, zk-SNARK proofs generated in real-time by the actor chain.â€‹

#### Achieving Quantum Resilience <a href="#achieving-quantum-resilience" id="achieving-quantum-resilience"></a>

In order for our systems to achieve a quantum resilient architecture, it is imperative to question the very nature of each technology at play to discover their faults and explorer their engines. One method we are currently implementing was recently formalized by researchers at IOHK with their tweakable sleeve. A tweakable sleeve implements a more modular novel sleeve mechanism leveraging a composition derived from a tweakable hash function. The beauty of the technology is the intended use case, as the protocol was designed to imbue quantum-resilience upon naturally non-quantum elliptic curve cryptographic protocols. Additionally, the unique proof of ownership injected into each signature duals as a disaster recovery mechanism seamlessly aligning with the properties needed for a seamlessly secure end-user experience.
