# Professional Pipeline

A professional pipeline is curated on-chain by the appropriate governing bodies. Each pipeline consists of several tiers retrofitted with courses taught by active professionals. Upon the completion of the minimum specified courses, the user will then be granted a unique non-fungible token for their continued use and participation in the accompanying job subnet.
