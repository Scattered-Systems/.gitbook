# Automations

Naturally supported by the platform is a plethora of well-developed automation pipelines awaiting users immediately upon sign-up. An incredible amount of detail was paid to the implementation of a fluid automation system, bound directly to the underlying architecture to ensure the complex processes remain out-of-mind when it comes to the end-user.&#x20;

### Shattering the global model

Rather than requiring users to train their AI engines from scratch, each instance of the platform carries with it a concise, self-configuring build mechanism enabling users to build-off of each other's work. Each interaction is automatically legered onto the mainnet as an inverted Cantor Set, enabling the continuously evolving global engine to recreate the interactions without any of the context provided by a Flow module.
