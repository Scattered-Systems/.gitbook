Proton natively supports a professional-grade productivity suite seamlessly integrated with the mainnet and the respective namespace enabling anyone to produce decentralized content with ease.

At any point the user may choose to publicize their content, hosting the object as a non-fungible token for purchase and consumption on the user's choice of locations.
