# Flow

Flow is a complete identity focused solution powered by a constant sized, hyper-light blockchain which further fuels a host of novel interactions when used in tandem with the rest of the ecosystem. One of the primary responsibilities of the Flow module is to actively interpret the intentions of the active user before routing justified transactions through the correct channels and proxying succinct proofs of the complete interaction onto Reaction.

Flow takes several lessons learned from across the general blockchain ecosystem to enable users like never before.&#x20;

The blockchain itself is derived from the Hydra Protocol as the introduction of isomorphic state channels directly services the ecosystem in several critical ways without introducing a large amount of overhead.&#x20;

## Focus Points

### Finances

Financial services are currently littered across the internet causing an enormous amount of confusion thus increasing the ability for malicious practices to persist. This is especially true when looking into defi as recent event have demonstrated that unless we can provide simple ways of validating the intent of the application, then everyday users will remain too scared to commit and the circle will continue. It is imperative that we engineer seamless experiences familiar to the broader public in order to sufficiently encourage them to explore a naturally more complicated and technical environment. Our commitment to centralizing the user experience is highlighted best with our unified financial portfolios. Each user will have immediate access to the network's common decentralized exchange and may begin automating trading activities with Proton's included automation hub. Furthermore, by supporting several integrations with critical centralized providers Proton is able to offer a number of traditional financial services routing requests and responses through the included oracle.&#x20;

### Digital Identity

One of the most important battles currently being waged between centralized and decentralized providers is that of the digital identity. Apple is pioneering several innovations in the field, recently including government issued identities within their Apple Wallet. While this is a huge step forwards for the concept as a whole, it is another indication that we may already be too late. In addition to this, the FIDO Alliance recently formalized a multi-device password-less authentication protocol mimicking the properties of blockchain wallets. That being said centralized service providers have a long way to go in reducing overall costs, facilitating payments, and ensuring the fidelity of all the information being processed by the respective system.&#x20;

### Namespaces

Namespaces is one of the most overlooked technologies and presents an elegant solution to several critical issues currently facing cutting edge computing. After successfully initializing your account, Flow scaffolds the registered namespace with critical infrastructure enabling each platform to remain globally accessible. Each namespace implements a robust set of features mimicking Docker container namespaces when used in tandem with the rest of the platform.

#### Aliases

Users will be issued three aliases, one to fulfill abstract circumstances, namely: personal, professional, and public engagements or views.
