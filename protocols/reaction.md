# Reaction

Reaction addresses the communal aspect of digital life, encompassing a variety of features from our decentralized exchange to our elegant NFT marketplace and more. Each account registered on Reaction represents another Flow module generated upon the download of Proton. This enables us to tie the ecosystem together, optimizing the process with built in proofs of ownership that further serve as disaster recovery mechanisms. Flow represents the active node the user is currently operating with, relying on Proton to establish further perspective. Each Flow node is a part of a small, personal network automatically scaffolded when compatible devices are registered to the namespace. This process encourages users to build-out their cloud platforms, securely orchestrating complex workloads from across the globe using either their own network's resources or by renting out resources from Disarray and participating parties.&#x20;

## Focus Points

### Governance

Reaction works in real time with engaging parties enabling a host of novel interactions to occur under circumstances adhering to the guidelines set forth before each engagement is allowed to begin.

### NFT Marketplace

A cornerstone of communities across the world are town centers where regional vendors can easily setup shop and begin selling produce, products, or elsewise. This is a concept that failed to persist in America, however, a resurgence of interest surrounding farmers markets and other similar ideas has been motivated in light of recent global events. Reaction implements a complete marketplace respecting the perspective and privacy of engaging parties, leveraging metadata embedded into their Flow modules to anonymously recommend content adhering to the filters set forth by the operator and generally depending upon the region of the request.

#### Extensions

Additionally, one of the most important aspects of the marketplace lies in the dedication to devising a complete extension marketplace. Extensions target a number of different sub-systems, encouraging targeted, purpose-driven code while increasing the flexibility and usability of the platform. Users are encouraged to build out their interfaces leveraging the extensions to quickly address thematic issues, customize their personal network's behavior with smart contracts, and more.

#### Shops

Each shop is generated as a result of a process initiated on the user's portal, seamlessly integrating with the low-code / no-code editor to allow owners the chance to express their individuality and properly represent their services. Upon reaching a satisfactory state, the user will be prompted to publish the interface for public access onto their decentralized namespace. The interface makes its way into the shop.app.ensname.eth link giving Reaction the foothold required to automatically import the items into the marketplace and advertise it accordingly.

### Metaverse

Reaction is also set to host the proposed metaverse, adding additional depth into each interaction. &#x20;
