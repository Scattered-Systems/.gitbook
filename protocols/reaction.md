# Reaction

Reaction's primary concern regards the community aspect of this project, combining the myriad of engagements enabled by the platform into an elegantly crafted digital universe of user created and owned surfaces. This accomplishes several things for us as it establishes a global image, reduces redundancies, and adds additional depth to the interactions facilitated by the platform with perspective-respecting guidelines automatically generated before each engagement.

Reaction addresses the community in several different ways including our unique digital marketplace, extensively developed gig-economy furthered with well-designed educational and professional sectors, and will eventually morph into a complete metaverse for users to engage in.

## Focus Points

### Governance

Reaction works in real time with engaging parties enabling a host of novel interactions to occur under circumstances adhering to the guidelines set forth before each engagement is allowed to begin.

### NFT Marketplace

A cornerstone of communities across the world are town centers where regional vendors can easily setup shop and begin selling produce, products, or elsewise. This is a concept that failed to persist in America, however, a resurgence of interest surrounding farmers markets and other similar ideas has been motivated in light of recent global events. Reaction implements a complete marketplace respecting the perspective and privacy of engaging parties, leveraging metadata embedded into their Flow modules to anonymously recommend content adhering to the filters set forth by the operator and generally depending upon the region of the request.

#### Extensions

Additionally, one of the most important aspects of the marketplace lies in the dedication to devising a complete extension marketplace. Extensions target a number of different sub-systems, encouraging targeted, purpose-driven code while increasing the flexibility and usability of the platform. Users are encouraged to build out their interfaces leveraging the extensions to quickly address thematic issues, customize their personal network's behavior with smart contracts, and more.

#### Shops

Each shop is generated as a result of a process initiated on the user's portal, seamlessly integrating with the low-code / no-code editor to allow owners the chance to express their individuality and properly represent their services. Upon reaching a satisfactory state, the user will be prompted to publish the interface for public access onto their decentralized namespace. The interface makes its way into the shop.app.ensname.eth link giving Reaction the foothold required to automatically import the items into the marketplace and advertise it accordingly.

### Metaverse

Reaction is also set to host the proposed metaverse, adding additional depth into each interaction. &#x20;
