# Chaos

Chaos implements a host of storage capabilities for the platform enabling Flow modules to store and retrieve information registered to the namespace across nearly any surface. Each node implements a robust proof-of-stake mechanism optimized for storage-oriented requests.&#x20;

### Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS)

One of the primary sources of storage is IPFS, a peer-to-peer hyper media transport protocol powering several decentralized projects across the world. Protocol Labs has extensively developed out a sound foundation leveraging Kademlia distributed hash tables for securely storing and retrieving information from their protocol. Currently, the protocol faces a few practical issues primarily surrounding the overhead participant's experience leading several initiatives to spawn in pursuit of a more optimized method of interfacing with it; examples including rust IPFS embedded, Berty Technologies, and Iroh.
