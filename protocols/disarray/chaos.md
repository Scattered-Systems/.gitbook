# Chaos

Chaos implements a host of storage capabilities for the platform enabling Flow modules to store and retrieve information registered to the namespace across nearly any surface. Each node implements a robust proof-of-stake mechanism optimized for storage-oriented requests.&#x20;

## Focus Points

### IoT

Chaos builds upon the scaffolded personal networks derived upon the registration of compatible devices. This extends the pre-existing functionality exponentially, focusing on management and orchestration of registered nodes.&#x20;

### Storage

#### Gateway

With Chaos, users can configure their clusters to include a variety of alternative providers enabling them to participate in the target networks or consume resources in an effort to lessen the load on their network.

#### _Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS)_

One of the primary sources of storage is IPFS, a peer-to-peer hyper media transport protocol powering several decentralized projects across the world. Protocol Labs has extensively developed out a sound foundation leveraging Kademlia distributed hash tables for securely storing and retrieving information from their protocol. Currently, the protocol faces a few practical issues primarily surrounding the overhead participant's experience leading several initiatives to spawn in pursuit of a more optimized method of interfacing with it; examples including rust IPFS embedded, Berty Technologies, and Iroh.

#### _Storj_

Another integration planned is with Storj, an object-oriented storage network natively supporting AWS S3-Gateway integrations making it one of the easier protocols to interface with. Storj enables several critical end-uses and offers a more secure destination for private information to persist.
