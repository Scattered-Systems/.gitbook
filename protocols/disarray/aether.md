# Aether

Aether builds upon the proof of work modules, leveraging the increased computational power to enable a host of containerization and virtualization services alongside traditional arithmetic. This abstracts a majority of the overhead away from both Proton and Flow, enabling them to remain lightweight and user-centric.
