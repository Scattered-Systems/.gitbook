# Flow

If each user is treated as their own, centralized provider than it becomes drastically simpler to consider the seemingly complex, dynamic architecture comprising the technical foundation of the platform.&#x20;

Flow is a complete identity focused solution powered by a constant sized, hyper-light blockchain which further fuels a host of novel interactions when used in tandem with the rest of the ecosystem. One of the primary responsibilities of the Flow module is to actively interpret the intentions of the active user before routing justified transactions through the correct channels and proxying succinct proofs of the complete interaction onto Reaction.

Each device registered is gauged by its resources and automatically configured to operate the mechanism best suited to the host environment. This further enables us to implement unique security parameters allowing end-users to restrict visual and informational layers from being activate on devices according to specifications outlined by the registrant.
