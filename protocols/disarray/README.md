# Disarray

Disarray combines lessons learned from across the blockchain ecosystem to create a post-quantum multi-chain powered with a unique node architecture that encourages network participation like never before. Following the formalization of the Minotaur protocol we are able to confidently engage in developing out a dynamic, multi-resource blockchain network.&#x20;

## Architecture

### Node Specifications

Each node in the network operates an inner core tightly wound around a WebAssembly runtime. Immediately surrounding the inner core is a thin runtime companion module capable of facilitating peer-to-peer transactions while reducing the overall overhead by relying upon the more robust outer core to power the networks computational layer. All commands issued to nodes operating under Aetheric (PoUW) or Chaotic (PoS) circumstances must be done so via valid Flow modules. These optimized sidechains are designed to be non-deterministic, directly contrasting traditional design. This is done so to enable a certain level of fluidity to occur within the functionality of the overall system as Aether and Chaos only achieve determinism when acted upon by a valid, semi-external actor, a.k.a. Flow. Flow automatically contextualizes or frames each transaction with the adequate justifications before routing them through the proper channels; the routing is determined based upon the type of request fulfilling compute and data on optimized surfaces before proving and proxying the responses onto Reaction for immutability.

## Consensus

The network relies upon the juxtaposition of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work philosophies to produce an optimized, dynamic multi-resource blockchain network. Following the recently formalized Minotaur protocol enables us to confidently explore the implementation of a hybrid network providing perhaps a more concrete validation regarding the motivation to explore such a system. While proof-of-stake has come a long way, it is by no means perfect and implementing a companion proof-of-work consensus protocol consequently optimizes both.

One primary benefit of implementing such a system is the increased opportunity for network participation, allowing both staking and mining operations to coexist. Additionally, as seen in a recent post (linked below), the prolonged dip in bitcoins price has drastically affected its participants while each new block being mined makes it that much more difficult to do so. This is something deeply considered in the formalized protocol as they experimentally verify the stability of a hybrid mechanism when contrasted against pow only blockchains such as Bitcoin.

### Engine

#### Part I: Proof of Stake Mechanism(s)&#x20;

For this half of the consensus engine, we have chosen to implement a derivation of the Ouroboros Praos protocol formalized by researchers at IOHK.

#### Part II: Proof of Work Mechanism(s)

The other half of the hybrid network is composed of nodes operating under proof-of-work circumstances, which formally implement the Ofelimos protocol. Ofelimos specifically outlines a proof-of-useful-work optimization on the original pow mechanism powering Bitcoin. Researchers at IOHK were able to formalize a provably secure blockchain protocol describing the motivation, security, and practicality of the specification while proposing several combinatorial optimizations naturally coming about as a result its inherent construction.
