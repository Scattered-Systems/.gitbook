# Proton

One of the primary issues currently facing blockchain technology is the overall usability of end-products as confusing markets, misinformation, and technical terminology lead to shrewd onboarding procedures and confusing products. This culminates into the misconception of blockchain technologies being limited in their applicability, servicing users with financial solutions rather than practical, day-to-day applications. After scouring the ecosystem for a viable solution, it quickly became apparent that a new method of interacting with these complex stateful technologies is required for the proper flow of information leading us to propose Proton. Proton visually manifests experiences facilitated by the platform leveraging the architecture to attain a certain level of malleability enabling all users to customize their spaces to their liking. Developing out a more tangible namespace for users to actively engage in meaningful, decentralized interactions enables the more technical solutions to blend elegantly into the very fabric of the platform.

## Focus Points

### Automation

Naturally supported by the platform is a plethora of well-developed automation pipelines awaiting users immediately upon sign-up. An incredible amount of detail was paid to the implementation of a fluid automation system, bound directly to the underlying architecture to ensure the complex processes remain out-of-mind when it comes to the end-user.&#x20;

#### Shattering the global model

Rather than requiring users to train their AI engines from scratch, each instance of the platform carries with it a concise, self-configuring build mechanism enabling users to build-off of each other's work. Each interaction is automatically legered onto the mainnet as an inverted Cantor Set, enabling the continuously evolving global engine to recreate the interactions without any of the context provided by a Flow module.

### Creative Visual Studio

#### Productivity

Proton natively supports a professional-grade productivity suite seamlessly integrated with the mainnet and the respective namespace enabling anyone to produce decentralized content with ease. Each article is naturally private and automatically pinned to the users' personal device cluster. At any point the user may choose to publicize their content, hosting the object as a non-fungible token for purchase and consumption on the user's choice of locations.
