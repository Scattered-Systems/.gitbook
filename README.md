During the initial construction of the platform, there were several technical challenges that needed to be addressed before being validated enough to pursue some of our more unique features. Luckily enough, a wave of recent advancements in blockchain and general cloud technologies have motivated a consistent refinement of the company’s image in preparation for the initial public offerings. These novelties have fueled an explosive effort to deliver on our vision, enabling everyday users to actively engage in meaningful interactions facilitated by decentralized technologies.

One of our primary considerations during this process was addressing the terrible onboarding process typically associated with blockchain technologies. Another consideration closely related to this was questioning the motivation for employing any system, thus restricting the developmental efforts to mission-critical endeavors deemed beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Combined these two considerations for the basis for understanding the more interactive features of the platform. Additionally, when considering the recent uptick in development of more refined personal computing platforms from centralized service providers it was imperative to inherit the feel of these traditional services shedding the rather unappealing characteristics of typical dApps. Some of the providers currently pursuing tangible examples of our efforts are highlighted by Apple with their recent updates to iCloud (web) as well as the Apple Wallet, Deta, and JetBrains in their packaged Fleet + Space combination. Apple’s recent push in the digital identity space has greatly benefited the field of computer science as a landmark capability that will be a cornerstone of their wallet for years to come. Furthermore, with the recent beta released for iCloud’s web interface it becomes clear that cloud-native solutions are the future and with that, personal cloud computing platforms. The question now remains, who will win out for the ultimate ecosystem, and will they be either a centralized or decentralized entity? For all of humanity, we wish it would be the latter even if our discussions merely inspire a larger initiative to deliver.

Our platform consists of five separate systems, each engineered to fulfill a specific abstraction required to execute and manage engagements, transactions, and other computationally driven desires. The architecture was derived following the formal definition of an automata significantly reducing the overall complexity and formally validating any individual pursuit. Flow can be best assimilated to the transition function of the 5-tuple, servicing the platform as the middleman responsible for representing the user to external systems. This is accomplished using a set of refined isomorphic-state channels for the automatic contextualization of non-deterministic compute surfaces found on Disarray with commands issues from the user before proving and proxying the responses onto the mainnet Reaction. Reaction is the last stop for all transactions tagged with the appropriate call signs as the service encompasses the communal aspect of our ecosystem. Proton serves as the common entry point for active users, integrating with the dynamic architecture to deliver a seamlessly secure, next generation internet-based experience. Included in the experience is a set of utilities dedicated to ensuring the malleability of the platform, featuring an extensively developed low-code / no-code editor for managing each visual sub-space and further integrated into the powerful automation engine native to each portal. The automation engine is accessible though its dashboard within Proton, enabling users to quickly compose complex pipelines using the drag n’ drop canvas. Additionally, a focus on centralizing access to services encouraged the development of unified and extensible dashboards for managing personal finances, information streams, and more.
