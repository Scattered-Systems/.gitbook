# Harmonizing Cloud Systems

In an effort to discover more natural and elegant manners of orchestrating cloud-native, distributed systems I propose a harmonic runtime environment suited for the ephemeral nature of the systems employed. Additionally, the need for such a system became more apparent when discussing the viability of generative visual experiences as the meaning of an application may drastically differ in final architecture and in thought-process.&#x20;

At the heart of this proposal lies the Neo-Riemannian Theory from Music Theory. The theory provides an elegant framework for our dynamical surfaces, describing nodes as two-tone preserving sets of LPR transformations.
