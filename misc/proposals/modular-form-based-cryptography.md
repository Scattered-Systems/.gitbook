description: Using modular forms in place of traditional elliptic curve

# Modular Form based Cryptography

I propose an alternative method of generating elliptic curve based cryptographic signatures, replacing traditional methods with modular forms as recently formalized under the Langlands Program.

## Part I - Background

#### Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Conjecture

The conjecture realizes a deep connection that persists between elliptic curves, infinite power series, and modular forms.&#x20;
