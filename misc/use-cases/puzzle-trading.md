# Puzzle Trading

Puzzles are one of those unique assets in life that essentially seem to lose value post-completion as few of us find much joy in completing the same puzzle again and again or forking over a handful of money to purchase new one. Scattered-Systems seeks to bring puzzles to life by turning these semi-single use products into tradable assets by creating an end-to-end process-oriented application to seamlessly connect users to other users, businesses, devices and objects themselves with Puzzled. Instead of completing and storing or selling the completed puzzles, simply upload a few images of it to verify the completion of the puzzle and be automatically ported into the community queue. Users will in-turn receive a digital mockup of their puzzle and a token which grants them access to the community library where they can anonymously checkout any of the other puzzles listed within the community.
