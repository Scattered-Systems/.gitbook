# Puzzle Trading

Puzzles are one of those items in life that tend to lose its value shortly after its completion, leading many to simply store or resell them. With our platform, old puzzles can find new meaning as leverage enabling users to participate in the regional library to checkout new puzzles, post their times for weekly competitions, and anonymously participate in the redistribution of the puzzles. Simply upload a few images of the completed puzzle before repacking it and selecting your next challenge. Upon delivery, the driver will confirm the integrity of the previous puzzle before dropping off the selected item.&#x20;

Implementing a concept such as this furthers networking participation in several ways as the distribution channels leveraged are part of a much larger planned service designed to directly service the unified NFT marketplace proposed formally in Reaction.
